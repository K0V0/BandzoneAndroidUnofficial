## TODO, ideas

- [x] Show user that band has no published tracks  
- [x] When search deleted, load random bands  
- [x] Notify user somehow that search is being performed (maybe little spinner in search field)  
- [ ] Maybe apply gestures for some actions (like back from Band profile to bands search)  
- [x] Rework band profile, find out how to put band info into list so it does not occupy space on screen and can be scrolled out  
- [ ] Make appearing band search results animated  
- [x] Pre Kristovu nohu if no bands found according to user request TELL HIM about it, no blank screen  
- [x] ~Resolve recyclerView artifacts - sometimes wiew with hidden buttons appearing for a wile can be seen (recycled view)~ they dissappeared, but I did nothing  
- [x] Put some small player widget on the bottom when in bands index/other band profile to give a user possibility to switch/stop currently playing track and give him clue what is he listening to  
- [x] Few bands unable to load, inpect this cases - [RESOLVED] - bands with at least one song that is less than miute long - bug in a Ruby on Rails scraper, not app itself  
- [x] Get rid of some HANDROid ugly stock icons  
- [x] [SERIOUS] Run player on background thread, loading track freezes UI  
- [x] [SERIOUS] Spaces in searchfield causes exception, scraper working OK, mistake here  
- [x] [SERIOUS] (in 0.1-alpha) If list of the track longer than screen and last track ends, app will crash  
- [x] [SERIOUS] on newer androids, content fetching not working 
- [ ] develop some mechanism to try to repeat lost request  
- [ ] [SERIOUS] Bandzone.cz has maintenance shutdown from 3:00 to 3:30 am, track this event, if I cannot do anything with it at least inform user about it.  
- [x] provide actual screenshots  
- [ ] lockscreen player widget  
- [ ] notification area player widget  
- [x] text on widget in bands list not changeing when song changed automatically  
- [x] change click listeners on track - missclick on free space in player causes track play again  
- [x] ability to download tracks and in gerenal ability to run offline with downloaded content - bands info and tracklist must be downloaded if at least one track is downloaded from band  
- [x] add incremental loading (pagination) for offline bands too (if for example 1000 results is issue for recycler view and sqlite, do research)  
- [x] reload bands activity on step back if connection changed during time spent inside band profile  
- [x] when playback paused in bands list and back into band profile or opposite, player state (in bands list) or player at all (in band profile) not restored  
- [x] add icon next to searchfield (in lace when loading wheel occurs) in bands list signalizing player mode (offline/online)  
- [x] ^ use that icon to toggle basic settings menu  
- [x] ^ in that menu, give user the possibility to work in offline mode even if data on (architecture done, just do menu)  
- [x] [IMPORTANT] in offline mode, grey out and remove click listeners on tracks that has not been downloaded  
- [x] ^ change download icon on that tracks to something that will inform user that he must download it first when online  
- [x] [SERIOUS] when going into band profile in offline mode, something black occupy half of the screen until track played, then content jumps  
- [x] [IMPORTANT] reload activities when connection on phone changed  
- [x] bug somewhere in db queries, removein all downloaded songs but band remains there  
- [x] sometimes when turning off data and paused player in band profile does not dissapear from not downloaded track  
- [x] maybe add bands that have downloaded tracks as first when app opened/searchfiled cleared  
- [x] [SERIOUS] bug resuming band profile activity while playing track - player missing, if clicked, app crashes  
- [x] [IMPORTANT] coming back from band profile gives you at the start of list, something forces activity restart  
- [ ] performace during scrolling list first time, maybe glide library issue for loading files stored offline  
- [x] [IMPORTANT] app loses connection and play only saved tracks after some time when phone screen off  
- [x] [IMPORTANT] times on some tracks inaccurate (10-20x times, see band "Container")  
- [x] set alphabetical ordering of saved bands  
- [x] when changing mode from offline or vice versa and reloading activity, searcfield content deleted if something there  
- [ ] check the possibility to add next/previous band to player widget in bands list  
- [ ] ^ add as setting(s) if repeat band tracks, stop playing, play next band 
- [x] let user know that track is downloaded and available offline before playing it - add icon to place of play/pause button
